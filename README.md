# A&D Studios
We are a company that produces games and other software and tools.

We are very passionate and involved in game development, and love all things computer and programming related. We also specialise in programming microcontrollers such as Arduino and Rapsberry Pi.

### Our future plans
We plan to conquer the games market by using and popularising innovative solutions and mechanics. We want to add an advanced AI system that will revolutionise our games which will stand out from other outdated gaming solutions. We also plan to create new solutions in electronics, such as the creation of a completely new key encryption, which will make hacking into user accounts border on the miraculous.
